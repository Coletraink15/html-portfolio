<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Howdy! I'm Cole and I enjoy working with Product Deisgn and Web Development! I am a Texas A&M graduate that enjoys 
  constantly learning and being able to further my knowledge with every opportunity that I can get.</p>

<p>I created multiple projects while attending Texas A&M and also enjoyed the Aggie lifestyle and friends that I made 
  along the way. The greatest impact on me was the proffesors that pushed me to go beyond my limits and they were always 
there to critique and help me improve, not only my work, but also myself as a person.</p>
